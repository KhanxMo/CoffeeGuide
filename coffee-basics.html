            <h3>Types of Coffee Beans</h3>
            <p>There are two main types of coffee beans: Arabica and Robusta. Arabica beans are known for their rich flavor, low acidity, and subtle fruit and nutty undertones. Robusta beans, on the other hand, are known for their strong, bitter flavor and high caffeine content.</p>
            <p>When shopping for coffee beans, it's important to consider the roast level as well. Roast levels range from light to dark, with light roasts having a more delicate flavor and dark roasts having a bolder, smokier flavor.</p>

            <h3>Brewing Methods</h3>
            <p>There are many different ways to brew coffee, each with its own unique flavor profile. Here are a few popular brewing methods:</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Drip Coffee:</strong> This is one of the most popular ways to brew coffee. Drip coffee makers work by pouring hot water over ground coffee beans, which then drips through a filter into a carafe.</li>
                <li><strong>French Press:</strong> French press coffee makers use a plunger to separate the coffee grounds from the brewed coffee. This method produces a rich, full-bodied flavor.</li>
                <li><strong>Pour Over:</strong> Pour over coffee makers work by slowly pouring hot water over ground coffee beans, which then drips through a filter into a carafe. This method produces a clean, crisp flavor.</li>
                <li><strong>Espresso:</strong> Espresso machines use high pressure to extract flavor from finely ground coffee beans. This method produces a rich, concentrated flavor and is the base for many coffee drinks like lattes and cappuccinos.</li>
            </ol>
