            <h3>Troubleshooting Common Espresso Problems</h3>
            <p>Even with the right equipment and techniques, espresso-making can be tricky. Here are some common problems and how to troubleshoot them:</p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Bitter taste:</strong> This could mean that the coffee is over-extracted. Try using less coffee or a coarser grind.</li>
              <li><strong>Sour taste:</strong> This could mean that the coffee is under-extracted. Try using more coffee or a finer grind.</li>
              <li><strong>No crema:</strong> This could mean that the coffee is too old or too coarse. Try using fresher coffee or a finer grind.</li>
              <li><strong>Channeling:</strong> This occurs when water finds a path of least resistance through the coffee grounds. Try using a more even tamp or adjusting the grind.</li>
            </ul>
